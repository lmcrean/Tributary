# Tributary Product Model

This document provides an overview of Tributary's monetization strategy and product model. For detailed information, see the linked documents.

## Overview

Tributary uses a freemium model with two tiers:

1. **Free Tier with Ads**: Basic functionality with strict limits and Google AdSense integration
2. **Premium Tier (£1.99/month)**: Expanded functionality, higher limits, and no ads

## Key Constraints

- **Budget Cap**: Strict £50 maximum budget for MVP development and validation
- **AWS Focus**: Using AWS services for implementation (valuable employment experience)
- **Self-Funding**: AdSense revenue should eventually cover AWS costs

| Validation | User acquisition, usage analysis | Months 5-6 |
